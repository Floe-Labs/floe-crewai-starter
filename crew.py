"""crew.py — a real, budget-governed CrewAI crew.

A minimal two-agent crew (a Researcher and a Writer) with a hard spend ceiling
wired in by default. One line — ``guard_crew(guard)`` — caps the WHOLE crew:
CrewAI runs every agent step through LiteLLM, so a single budget callback meters
every agent and every task under one ceiling. If the crew would cross it, the
next LLM call is refused (``BudgetExceeded``) instead of running.

Run it (needs an LLM key)::

    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    python crew.py

The ceiling defaults to $1.00; override with FLOE_BUDGET_USD.

Optional hosted upgrade
-----------------------
If FLOE_API_KEY is set, this script makes ONE read-only GET to Floe's credit API
for your agent's server-side remaining budget and tightens the local cap to it.
Be honest about what that is: the read only INFORMS the local, in-process
ceiling. The un-bypassable, cross-vendor enforcement is the hosted Floe product
running server-side — not this script. Any read failure (missing key, network,
parse) falls back safely to the local cap.
